%title Linux管道命令
= 命名管道fifo =
可以把管道想象为两个实体之间的单向连接器。管道是半双工的，如果需要全双工通讯，应该转而考虑套接字。 匿名管道又称管道，提供了一个进程与它的兄弟进程通讯的方法，只存在于父进程中；命名管道，可以存在于文件系统中，任意进程都可找到它，使得不同先祖的进程也可以通讯。 

{{{
A FIFO special file (a named pipe) is similar to a pipe, except that
       it is accessed as part of the file system.  It can be opened by
       multiple processes for reading or writing.  When processes are
       exchanging data via the FIFO, the kernel passes all data internally
       without writing it to the file system.  Thus, the FIFO special file
       has no contents on the file system; the file system entry merely
       serves as a reference point so that processes can access the pipe
       using a name in the file system.

       The kernel maintains exactly one pipe object for each FIFO special
       file that is opened by at least one process.  The FIFO must be opened
       on both ends (reading and writing) before data can be passed.
       Normally, opening the FIFO blocks until the other end is opened also.

       A process can open a FIFO in nonblocking mode.  In this case, opening
       for read-only will succeed even if no-one has opened on the write
       side yet, opening for write-only will fail with ENXIO (no such device
       or address) unless the other end has already been opened.

       Under Linux, opening a FIFO for read and write will succeed both in
       blocking and nonblocking mode.  POSIX leaves this behavior undefined.
       This can be used to open a FIFO for writing while there are no
       readers available.  A process that uses both ends of the connection
       in order to communicate with itself should be very careful to avoid
       deadlocks.
